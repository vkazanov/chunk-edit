* chunk-edit.el - Edit code chunks from multiple files in one buffer

** Overview

*chunk-edit* is an Emacs package that lets you edit code chunks from various sources
within a single buffer. It provides syntax highlighting and the ability to save changes
back to the original files or buffers.

** Features

- Edit code chunks from multiple files or regions in one buffer.
- Syntax highlighting using each chunk's major mode.
- Save and revert changes to the original sources.
- Navigate between chunks easily with keybindings.

** Installation

Place =chunk-edit.el= in your Emacs =load-path=, and add the following to your
configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'chunk-edit)
#+end_src

** Usage

The package maintains a buffer (the Chunk-Edit buffer, ~*chunk-edit*~ by default) that
collects chunks the users intends to edit. ~chunk-edit~ switches to the buffer, while
~chunk-edit-insert-*~ commands insert buffer regions or files as chunks into the buffer.

Within the Chunk-Edit buffer chunks can be edited, saved back (=C-c s=) to sources,
reverted (=C-c r=), etc. Global commands:

Create or switch to the Chunk-Edit buffer: ~M-x chunk-edit~.

Insert file as Chunk into the Chunk-Edit buffer: ~M-x chunk-edit-insert-file~

Insert current region as Chunk into the Chunk-Edit buffer: ~M-x chunk-edit-insert-region~
