 - [X] open buffer in a chunk-edit mode

 - [X] insert chunk

 - [X] load file chunk

 - [X] save chunk back to file based on overlay info at point

 - [X] mark/unmark chunks as edited

 - [X] close chunk

 - [X] pages

 - [X] highlighting chunks based on a mode (how does org-mode do it?)

   see org-src-font-lock-fontify-block for inspiration

   - [X] manual highlighting function run once

   - [X] autorefresh (add to font-lock?)

 - [X] make chunk loader into a protocol, like a set of functions (defstruct, or a plist)

   - [X] a protocol

   - [X] a simple file-backed backend

   - [X] protocol to include delimeter info

   - [X] a currently open buffer

 - [X] source modification timestamp and it's check

 - [X] switch to marker for monitoring sources of chunks and reverting?

 - [X] chunk properties should not include contents

 - [X] fix sync for file backends

 - [X] test suite

   - [X] file backend

   - [X] region backend

 - [X] make sure kill is run for all chunks when kill the chunk-edit buffer

 - [X] mode keybindings

   - [X] save (C-s s)

   - [X] chunk from file (C-c i f)

   - [X] revert chunk (C-c r)

   - [X] go to chunk source (C-c o)

   - [X] kill chunk (C-c k)

   - [X] kill all and close chunk-edit (C-c C-q)

   - [X] save all (C-c C-s)

   - [X] revert all (C-c C-c)

 - [X] license

 - [X] README.org

 - [ ] editing first symbol does not mark the chunk as modified

 - [ ] unsynced and not modified? Revert immediately

 - [X] global keybindings

   - [X] insert file / insert buffer / insert region should all be global functions

     no need to be in the file, just assume there's one (or create one if necessary)

 - [-] chunk-edit UI

   - [X] next/prev chunk

   - [ ] read-only outside of chunks

   - [ ] chunk manipulation

   - [ ] better chunk delimiting

 - [ ] eask lint at all

Further ideas:

 - [ ] better delimeters and meta info display

 - [ ] visible global MOD UNSYNC modifiers

 - [ ] additional backends

   - [ ] database

   - [ ] full buffer

 - [ ] polymode-like syntax/navigation handling through indirect buffers?

 - [ ] make chunk sources or chunks read only (by default?)

 - [ ] narrow to chunk

 - [ ] edit in a separate buffre

 - [ ] A chunk of text without a source

 - [ ] Serializing chunks

 - [ ] external chunks in other modes or org-mode (like src blocks but saveable)

 - [ ] check with tramp?
